## Prerequisites

The Node.js runtime (version 22+).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can then use an editor to start modifying pages such as `app/page.js`. A modified page auto-updates in the browser after you save it.
